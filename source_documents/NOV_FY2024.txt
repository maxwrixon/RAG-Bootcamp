	Portfolio Trends	31+ Delinquency
•	Balances continue to decrease mainly due to lower Mortgage credit demand and reduced Auto originations impacted from de-risking, rising vehicle prices and higher rates, partially offset by Unsecured products
•	%31+ delinquency at 0.63%, slightly higher MoM (+1bp) with largest increases observed in Prime Auto (+8bps) and Near-Prime Auto (+38bps) followed by RESL (+1bp).
•	YoY delinquency continues to climb across all products except for Credit Cards which is showing stable trends for %31+ (-1bps) and %91+ (-2bps).
As of Oct’23
Originations
•	New bookings are relatively stable MoM ($5.1Bn, +1%), however, are lower QoQ (-5.8%) and YoY (-23%) mainly driven by large reductions in Mortgages and Prime Auto (-33% and -31% respectively) in line with industry trends and de-risking expectations.
•	Vintage delinquency of 0.55% improved 7bps MoM driven by reductions in Lines of Credit and Prime Auto. However, delinquency remains higher QoQ and YoY across most products (except for SDA and Cards) and driven by the effects of lower mortgage weighting contribution on total retail delinquency levels.
Takeaways
•	Despite higher interest rates, Mortgage indebtedness levels at origination have decreased after management actions. Proportion of ‘Uninsured Mortgages with booked TDSR>50%’ has decreased from 9.1% in Q2F23 to 5.6% (SCC limit of 7%).
•	Cards %91+ continue to show stable performance (-2bps YoY) in contrast with all other retails products (Prime Auto +55%, ULOC +39%, and HELOC +134%). Cards receivables have increased Y/Y by over $1Bn in part driven by Risk strategy changes.
•	%91+ for HELOC and ULOC is higher Q/Q and Y/Y, with HELOC reaching highest levels in last 5 years.

	Highlights - ACE F2023 	19
Automotive
o	DFC POI waiver reduced on funded application from 25% in Nov ’22 down to 8% Oct ’23 – part of derisking strategy and risk mitigation to the Bank o Cross Senior Support – in absence of Director to support 15-hour workday – maintaining the 25-minute Service Level Agreement RESL
o	Funded conventional non-program applications - TDSR over 50% decreased from 10.6% in April 2023 to 4.2% in September 2023 – part of overall de-risking strategy and to reduce below the Senior Credit Committee (SCC) level of 7%. 
o	Clarification of policy for Total number of property limits, Qualification of amortization for LOC only applications, bridge loans, review of 19 current items.
o	Automated Officer – Implementation for all RESL applications – reduces non-material amendments from 17 mins to 2 mins – fiscal year reviewed 1,735 applications – Speed to Customer and improves staff capacity.
o	Private Baking – removal of Summary of Personal Finance and Business Needs assessment review from ACE – reduce Action Request to the Business Line Unsecured Lending
•	Unsecured – New to Canada policy to align with the Foreign Worker 
•	BNS Aggregate credit using the higher of the two and not using combined (applicable for RESL as well) – clarity from GRM 
•	Private Banking Credit Limit Increase (CLI) – through constellation and CCRL – new process to support decommission of ReCap Small Business
•	Collaboration with GRM on Exception reporting as current reporting did not capture OM exceptions accurately. New reporting reflect 6741 vs 2138 reported previously.	Ongoing efforts will continue
•	Simplification of the SPP ACE Plus intake form creating additional capacity of 6-8 minutes per application representing 10% savings in time to underwrite. In addition, it saves time for LSSB allowing them to cut and paste conditions faster
•	CRU risk parameters revisited and simplified, resulting in a 60-70% reduction in reviews sent to ACE with future FTE savings
•	Enhancements to DSR which ACE identified and tested prior to launch which is improving accuracy and flexibility to spread larger connections	 

 
•	Unsecured volumes decreased ~22% M/M and up ~ 30% Y/Y. The increase Y/Y is attributed to the focus on Credit Card growth and additional growth in New to Canada (NTC) and Refugee programs.
•	For High Value Customer (HVC) applications, ~ 54% are reviewed and decisioned within 1 hour and ~79% are reviewed and decisioned within 4 hours.
•	Additional focus has been placed on cross channel support to ensure that we are fully leveraged for peaks in volumes in the Retail Channel and other areas of ACE . We continue to meet SLA for the month of October (SLA- 100%)

•	Retail, HFS & SMA = 85%
•	HVC = 90%
More than 5% below target
0%-5% below target Equal/Above target
4.	Automated Officer: CEA automated decision for nonmaterial amendments and a TDSR variance <2%.
Note: AO volumes are already accounted for within Overall Volumes.
5.	HFS Volumes includes E-Home applications. 
•	Retail and HVC volumes output increased 3% and 16% respectively M/M . Volume increased slightly due to competitive rates (bundle package) and time of year. This was the expectation that volumes could increase marginally in October but volume for remainder of the calendar year will be lower than Y/Y monthly numbers.
•	Indirect Mortgage saw an increase M/M of 20%. (SMA volumes up 24% and HFS up 14%). Market is up slightly in October v September and Bundle package likely has provided more interest especially in the Broker/SMA channel. De-risking measures continue to hinder some volumes from the business line and therefore to ACE.
•	Total TAT remains strong with ~ 69% of RESL applications being decisioned within 1 hour and ~88% within 4 hours.

Vintage at 6MOB is +9 bps higher QoQ, mainly driven by significantly lower weighting contributions from RESL originations, coupled with elevated delinquency levels on Prime Auto and Unsecured lines. Vintage delinquency continues to normalize across most products, partially offset by improvements in Near Prime Auto and Credit Cards, in line with industry trends and remain below F’23 SCC Limit.

	Portfolio Trends	31+ Delinquency
•	Balances continue to decrease mainly due to lower Mortgage credit demand and reduced Auto originations impacted from de-risking, rising vehicle prices and higher rates, partially offset by Unsecured products
•	%31+ delinquency at 0.63%, slightly higher MoM (+1bp) with largest increases observed in Prime Auto (+8bps) and Near-Prime Auto (+38bps) followed by RESL (+1bp).
•	YoY delinquency continues to climb across all products except for Credit Cards which is showing stable trends for %31+ (-1bps) and %91+ (-2bps).
As of Oct’23
Originations
•	New bookings are relatively stable MoM ($5.1Bn, +1%), however, are lower QoQ (-5.8%) and YoY (-23%) mainly driven by large reductions in Mortgages and Prime Auto (-33% and -31% respectively) in line with industry trends and de-risking expectations.
•	Vintage delinquency of 0.55% improved 7bps MoM driven by reductions in Lines of Credit and Prime Auto. However, delinquency remains higher QoQ and YoY across most products (except for SDA and Cards) and driven by the effects of lower mortgage weighting contribution on total retail delinquency levels.
Takeaways
•	Despite higher interest rates, Mortgage indebtedness levels at origination have decreased after management actions. Proportion of ‘Uninsured Mortgages with booked TDSR>50%’ has decreased from 9.1% in Q2F23 to 5.6% (SCC limit of 7%).
•	Cards %91+ continue to show stable performance (-2bps YoY) in contrast with all other retails products (Prime Auto +55%, ULOC +39%, and HELOC +134%). Cards receivables have increased Y/Y by over $1Bn in part driven by Risk strategy changes.

	Highlights - ACE F2023 	19
Automotive
o	DFC POI waiver reduced on funded application from 25% in Nov ’22 down to 8% Oct ’23 – part of derisking strategy and risk mitigation to the Bank o Cross Senior Support – in absence of Director to support 15-hour workday – maintaining the 25-minute Service Level Agreement RESL
o	Funded conventional non-program applications - TDSR over 50% decreased from 10.6% in April 2023 to 4.2% in September 2023 – part of overall de-risking strategy and to reduce below the Senior Credit Committee (SCC) level of 7%. 
o	Clarification of policy for Total number of property limits, Qualification of amortization for LOC only applications, bridge loans, review of 19 current items.
o	Automated Officer – Implementation for all RESL applications – reduces non-material amendments from 17 mins to 2 mins – fiscal year reviewed 1,735 applications – Speed to Customer and improves staff capacity.
o	Private Baking – removal of Summary of Personal Finance and Business Needs assessment review from ACE – reduce Action Request to the Business Line Unsecured Lending
•	Unsecured – New to Canada policy to align with the Foreign Worker 
•	BNS Aggregate credit using the higher of the two and not using combined (applicable for RESL as well) – clarity from GRM 
•	Private Banking Credit Limit Increase (CLI) – through constellation and CCRL – new process to support decommission of ReCap Small Business
•	Collaboration with GRM on Exception reporting as current reporting did not capture OM exceptions accurately. New reporting reflect 6741 vs 2138 reported previously.	Ongoing efforts will continue
•	Simplification of the SPP ACE Plus intake form creating additional capacity of 6-8 minutes per application representing 10% savings in time to underwrite. In addition, it saves time for LSSB allowing them to cut and paste conditions faster
•	CRU risk parameters revisited and simplified, resulting in a 60-70% reduction in reviews sent to ACE with future FTE savings
•	Enhancements to DSR which ACE identified and tested prior to launch which is improving accuracy and flexibility to spread larger connections	 

 
•	Unsecured volumes decreased ~22% M/M and up ~ 30% Y/Y. The increase Y/Y is attributed to the focus on Credit Card growth and additional growth in New to Canada (NTC) and Refugee programs.
•	For High Value Customer (HVC) applications, ~ 54% are reviewed and decisioned within 1 hour and ~79% are reviewed and decisioned within 4 hours.
•	Additional focus has been placed on cross channel support to ensure that we are fully leveraged for peaks in volumes in the Retail Channel and other areas of ACE . We continue to meet SLA for the month of October (SLA- 100%)

2.	Y/Y represents YTD change between this fiscal year and last fiscal year.
3.	SLA Targets
•	Retail, HFS & SMA = 85%
•	HVC = 90%
More than 5% below target
0%-5% below target Equal/Above target
4.	Automated Officer: CEA automated decision for nonmaterial amendments and a TDSR variance <2%.
Note: AO volumes are already accounted for within Overall Volumes.
5.	HFS Volumes includes E-Home applications. 
•	Retail and HVC volumes output increased 3% and 16% respectively M/M . Volume increased slightly due to competitive rates (bundle package) and time of year. This was the expectation that volumes could increase marginally in October but volume for remainder of the calendar year will be lower than Y/Y monthly numbers.
•	Indirect Mortgage saw an increase M/M of 20%. (SMA volumes up 24% and HFS up 14%). Market is up slightly in October v September and Bundle package likely has provided more interest especially in the Broker/SMA channel. De-risking measures continue to hinder some volumes from the business line and therefore to ACE.
•	Total TAT remains strong with ~ 69% of RESL applications being decisioned within 1 hour and ~88% within 4 hours.

While Y/Y saw a decrease in Finance of ~31% and an increase in Leases ~31% Business Line volumes continue to be lower Y/Y, ACE is reviewing a lower percentage of volumes due to de-risking measures and increase in interest rates.
•	Near Prime (SDA) decreased ~12% M/M and decreased ~15% Y/Y.
•	Productivity continues to be challenging over the last 10 months with a decrease in volumes due to de-risking and an increase in interest rates.
•	A focus on cross channel support has been implemented as ACE continues to see spikes in daily volumes in other channels and staff is utilized to support SLA across ACE.

Canadian Banking – Guardrails Update 	  Below F23 Limit 	  Above F23 Early Warning Threshold	  Above F23 Risk Appetite Threshold
Vintage at 6MOB is +9 bps higher QoQ, mainly driven by significantly lower weighting contributions from RESL originations, coupled with elevated delinquency levels on Prime Auto and Unsecured lines. Vintage delinquency continues to normalize across most products, partially offset by improvements in Near Prime Auto and Credit Cards, in line with industry trends and remain below F’23 SCC Limit.
